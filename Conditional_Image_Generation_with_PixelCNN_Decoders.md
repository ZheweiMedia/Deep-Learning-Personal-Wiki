# Summary

* What
    * This paper expores

* How
    * The authors proposed a data-dependent dropout which depend on the second order statistics of the data distribution.
In practice, the data distribution means data of a batch.
    * They also proposed a evolutional droput which consider about the distribution
of the layer's outputs.
  
* Results
