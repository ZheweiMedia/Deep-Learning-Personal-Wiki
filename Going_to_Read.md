* In pixelCNN, they mentioned that: Feed-forward neural networks with gates have been
explored in previous works, such as highway neworks [25], grid LSTM [13] and neural GPUs [12].
* https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.00783.pdf. Pixel Recursive Super Resolution. This one use pixelCNN. Pixel level work.
* pixelRNN. Good point: better receive filed than CNN. Bad: too slow. Can we use facebook's seq2seq CNN solution?
