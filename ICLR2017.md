* **Paying More Attention to Attention: Improving the Performance of Convolutional Neural Networks via Attention Transfer**
    ** Transfer learning on attention
    ** Summarize some good papers about visualizing attention maps
    ** By make a small thin student network mimic the teacher network of attention, the small thin student can perform better.
